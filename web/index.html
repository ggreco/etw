<img align=right src=images/etwsmall.gif><p><b>Eat The Whistle</b> is an <b>opensource</b> soccer game originally developed by <a href="http://www.aspide.it/freeweb/hurricane/">Hurricane Studios</a> as commercial product for the Amiga platform. It has a lot of features never seen in other soccer games. <p>
The original Amiga version has been made portable with the help of the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL library</a>, now <b>ETW</b> runs on a wide range of machines, the site will keep precompiled binaries
for Win32, Linux, MacOSX, AmigaOS, but it's possible to adapt it to run on every platform supported by <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a>.
<p>

    <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> project page. Or

Actually this section is quite old and not updated but I hope to make it more useful in future, anyway it can give some ideas about the features of the game!
<p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><img src="images/arb_anim.gif">Requirements:
<ul><p>
    <li>One of the following machine:
    <ul>
        <li> A Windows (95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP) PC with at least 32MB of ram and a pentium class processor.
        <li> An x86 linux box with similar features and X11.
        <li> A MacOSX capable macintosh.
        <li> An Amiga with a GFX card, AHI, 040 or better.
    </ul>
    <li>The SDL runtime (1.2.0 or better) matching your configuration, you can find it
        <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php">here</a>.
</ul>
<p>
<li><img src="images/plr_anim.gif">Here are some of the features:
<p>
<ul>
    <li>System friendly. Run in a window or fullscreen, can be played also on old machines (runs pefectly on a P200).
<li><a href=images/worldcup.gif>World cup</a>, leagues, cups with real teams (with slightly modified names).
<li>Time synchronized, faster CPU get faster framerate but not faster gameplay.

<li>Can be played through keyboard or joypad/joysticks (USB or Gameport).

<li>Network playing through TCP/IP (not yet finished).

<li> Very intuitive control method with acceleration/deceleration.

<li> More than 550 frames of animations for the players, 300 for the goalkeeper,
  100 for the refree and a lot of other graphics.

<li> 30 different fields, including muddy, frozen and wet (actually only one 
  included in the demo version to contain the archive size).

<li> Fouls, corners, throw-in with an intuitive control system.

<li> Role playing. (You can play a match as the whole team or only as a
  player).

<li> About every thing in the game is configurable via <a href=images/config.gif>intuitive menus</a>.

<li> Game Tactics and tactic editor.

<li> Heading and other special shots with intuitive controls.

<li> Team players (with individual stats) and team editor (the editor is actually available only for AmigaOS).

<li> Import SWOS teams.

<li> Arcade-like actions for <a href=images/arcade.gif>"arcade mode"</a> (powerups, bonuses... something like
  speedball II).

<li> Replays (with load/save option).

<li>Spoken comment (actually broken).

</ul>
<p>
<li><img src=images/gk_anim.gif><b>Eat The Whistle</b> it's probably one the most configurable soccer game written, it
has tons of options, here are some examples (click <a href=images/config.gif>here</a> for a picture
that shows one of the configuration menus):<p><ul>
<li> you can play it with Joystick, two-button joystick,
joypad or keyboard (two different, and configurable keyboard control methods), the joypad
control is very similar to the Playstation's ISSPro one.
<li> There are 8 different pitch types and 7 different pitch conditions, the pitch condition
modify the aspect of the field! You can play on a wet field or on a snow covered one,
in this case the players will wear gloves <img align=middle src=images/snow_anim.gif>!
<li> You can choose the daytime of the match, if the match is played in the evening the players have 4 shadows.
<li> You can choose screenmode (<a href=images/etwhires.gif>example hires picture</a>), radar size, if you want to see always the match result or the active player name...
<li> You can play friendly matches, cups, leagues, world cups (<a href=images/worldcup.gif>picture</a>)
, training, penalties, free kicks.
<li> There is a great <b>Arcade Mode</b> with two different pitches that seem an arena and with 
11 custom "arcade teams" (<a href=images/arcadesel.gif>picture</a>)(one is the secret one) and you can do a challenge
similar to a beat'em'up with the gameplay that is mix between speedball and a soccer game!
(<a href=images/arcade.gif>picture</a>)
<li> There are a <b>LOT</b> of cheat modes!
<p>
