Eat the Whistle
---------------

Eat The Whistle is a football game originally released for Amiga in 1999, then made opensource and ported to windows, mac and linux in 2003.

In 2013 I released an heavily customized version for iOS and Android.

The project is still maintained and it's part of the debian repositories.

The game is written in C and uses SDL (www.libsdl.org) as video/input/audio module.

It provides a "simulation" and an "arcade" game mode.
